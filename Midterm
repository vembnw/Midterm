<h1>I will provide some information about myself.</h1>

<p>INFOTC 1000 is the first class I have taken that has taught me how to code.</p>
<br>
<p>I am an Environmental Science major, so my classes do not utilize coding very often.</p>
<br>
<p>Here is a list of my hobbies.<p>
<ol>
<li>Hiking</li>
<li>Gardening</li>
<li>Watching movies</li>
<li>Reading books</li>
<li>Playing Animal Crossing on my switch</li>
</ol>

<p>I have 2 siblings and 3 step-siblings.</p>
<p>My parents divorced when I was 14 years old.</p>
<p>I have an older brother named Troy and a younger sister named Isabella.</p> 
<p>We are all named after cities in Texas. My parents are from Texas, which explains the name idea.</p>
<p>My older brother is 25 years old, and my little sister is 16 years old.</p>
<p>I am 20 years old.</p>
