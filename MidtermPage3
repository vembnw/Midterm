<h1>For this next page, I want to focus on my childhood</h1>

<p>I grew up in <em>Mempis,TN</em>.</p>
![Downtown Memphis is gorgeous!](https://www.10best.com/destinations/tennessee/memphis/downtown/)
<br>
<p>I was born in Missouri. However, my family moved a lot.</p>
<p>My father was active duty military when I was a kid</p>
<br>
<p>I have lived in Missouri, Rhode Island, Georgia, and Tennessee.</p>
<p>I consider TN to be my home, since I lived there from when I was 6 years old.</p>
<p>I have the most memories of Memphis, so it is my home.</p>
Here is a link of [things to do in Mempis](https://www.10best.com/destinations/tennessee/memphis/downtown/)
<br>
<p>Now, I am back in Missouri attending<strong>Mizzou</strong>!</p>
Here is a link to the [Mizzou website](https://missouri.edu/)
<p>I could not be happier!</p>
