<h1>For this next page, I want to focus on my future.</h1>

<p>I am very invested in <em>sustainability</em>.</p>
<br>
<p>I could see myself in the future teaching about sustainability.</p>
<p>Alternatively, I could work for a company that develops new sustainable products.</p>
![Example of sustainable products!](https://ensia.com/features/environmentally-responsible-products-consumerism/)
<br>
<p>I am an environmental science major, so a lot of what we talk about is sustainability.</p>
<p>Climate change is ruining the planet, and it needs to be stopped.</p>
<p>Sustainable practices can slow the speed of climate change.</p>
<br>
<p>My future is still undecided, but that is okay with me.</p>
<p>I am just excited to see how things will turn out for me.</p>
