<h1>For this next page, I want to focus on my pets.</h1>

<p>I personally own a <em>flamepoint Siamese cat</em> named Toast.</p>
<br>
<p>My roommates also have cats. One named Lulu and one named Miko.</p>
<p>Therefore, in my household in Columbia I have three pets in total.</p>
<br>
<p>My mom and step-dad Dave have a dog named Kat.</p>
<p>My father and step-mother Suzie have three dogs and a cat.</p>
<p>Their dogs are named Ginger, Tabasco, and Cosmo. The cat is named Obi.</p>
<br>
<p>I have always been surrounded by <strong>lots</strong> of pets!</p>
<p>i just love <strong>my cat Toast</strong>.</p>
